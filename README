Object Introspector 
=================================
by Stefan Deusch, June 12, 2014


1. Summary
===========
This project is a POC of a command console for showing and manipulating Java objects. 

2. Design 
===========
Core Java 6 using the Apache Commons-Lang-3.1 and beanutils-core-1.8.3 libraries for reflection of Java beans. 

3. Requirements
===============
Java 6 JRE or JDK installed with executable 'java' on the PATH, or with JAVA_HOME set explicitly to the 
installation directory of Java. Bash shell (works on Mac by default, or on Windows with cygwin installed)

4. Deployment
=============
Unzip the tar.gz file of this project to a directory, or clone it from this git repository. 

5. Usage
==============
Start the command console by running the bash shell script:
> ./run.sh 

    The console output looks like this:
    deuscs01-mac:ObjectIntrospector deuscs01$ ./run.sh 
    Using Classpath: .:./lib/commons-beanutils-core-1.8.3.jar:./lib/commons-lang3-3.1.jar:./lib/commons-logging-api-1.1.jar:bin
    /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_05.jdk/Contents/Home/:/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_05.jdk/Contents/Home//bin/java
    Using version :/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_05.jdk/Contents/Home//bin/java
    Now running: /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_05.jdk/Contents/Home//bin/java -cp .:./lib/commons-beanutils-core-1.8.3.jar:./lib/commons-lang3-3.1.jar:./lib/commons-logging-api-1.1.jar:bin introspect.ObjectShell

    Loaded object of type [test.Sample] with value Sample [name=John Doe, income=85000, alpha=1.0E-9]

The last line prints out that an instance of object test.Sample has been loaded.

To print out the value of one attribute of this object, type 'GET propertyname', e.g. 
>GET name
prints out 
     Object member: name, value = John Doe

To print out all attribute values of the current object, type 'GET *', in our example 
> GET *
	Object member: name, value = John Doe
	Object member: income, value = 85000
	Object member: alpha, value = 1.0E-9
	
To set the value of an existing attribute, type 'SET propertyname=value', e.g. 
> SET income=90000
    value of attribute income changed to 90000

Type 'HELP' to get a help screen with instructions of how to use each command.
Type 'exit' to leave the shell.


6. Extension
============
The object introspector can be set to a different object instance in the Java Virtual Machine. Type 'USE class'.
This currently loads a new instance by the fully qualified class name using the empty default constructor of the class. 
You can print out the values of its attributes with the 'GET' command and change them with the 'SET' command.
